**Summary**:
Between 8:00 AM and 8:30 AM on April 4, 2025, 1 user encountered a failure when attempting to order pizza. The issue was triggered by a malicious external attack at 8:15 AM, during which a URL was injected into the application and returned in place of the proper order response.

The malformed URL (https://cs329.cs.byu.edu/api/report?apiKey=57aa4dde145649a2a5ed7bb03f97b898&fixCode=85d420f283a846c5ace21dcc608f05e9) caused the service to respond with a reporting link instead of processing the order. This bug was detected by Grafana, which triggered an alert. The on-call engineer navigated to the provided URL and resolved the issue.

This SEVERITY LEVEL 1 incident affected 100% of users attempting to place orders during the outage window.

**Detection**:

The incident was detected by a Grafana alert, which notified the on-call JWT pizza worker. The injected URL was quickly identified as the root cause of the invalid order response.

Improvement Plan:
An input sanitization and validation layer will be implemented by the Pizza Platform Security Team, to prevent malformed or malicious URLs from being processed or injected into user-facing responses.

**Impact**:

For 30 minutes, from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM UTC on 04/04/2025, all users of the pizza ordering service were affected.

This incident impacted 1 user (100%) of the pizza order fulfillment system, who experienced failures when attempting to place valid orders.

Support:

0 support tickets were submitted

0 social media posts reported the outage

**Timeline**:

All times are UTC.
- _2:00_ - Pizza ordering service functioning normally
- _2:15_ - Malicious URL injected, service starts failing orders
- _2:17_ - Grafana alert triggered
- _2:20_ - On-call engineer Mackensey T acknowledges page and begins investigation
- _2:25_ - Engineer identifies injected URL and navigates to provided reporting link
- _2:30_ - Temporary fix applied, orders restored

**Response**:

Upon receiving the Grafana alert at 8:17 AM, Mackensey T was paged and came online by 8:20 AM. The team followed standard incident response procedures and resolved the incident within 10 minutes.

**Root cause**:

The issue stemmed from a lack of input sanitization, which allowed an externally crafted URL to be injected and treated as a valid response. This URL bypassed the normal order creation process and caused the API to return an invalid response format.

**Resolution**:
By visiting the malware website it ended the attack and permanitly ended the attack.

**Action Items**:

1. Add input validation and sanitization to the pizza ordering endpoint
2. Unit tests covering edge cases and malformed input scenarios
3. Mock external service responses to isolate internal logic during tests
4. Create a firewall rule to filter and flag suspicious external content
5. Add Grafana alert descriptions with mitigation links and fixCode responders
6. Conduct postmortem analysis and security training for engineering teams
